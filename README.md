# POSIX Build System (pbs)
This project is a subproject for another subproject to replace Tsoding's great nob.h.
With a posix adhering library using only posix libraries (and linux since linux isn't posix technically).
This is to not support Windows because it's too strange and a lot of posix is already ported using mingw.
It's just more fun writing code for real systems.

## Usage
It is designed after tsoding/nob.h, so bootstrapped system kind of where a pbs.c file is defined with a main.
This file specifies the recipe for building stuff.

Currently nothing special, just an array of strings that represents a command and gets executed.
